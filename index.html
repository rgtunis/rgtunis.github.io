								<h3>My interests</h3>
								<p>I am primarily interested in how health and biometric data are collected and used by technology companies.
									In particular, I am interested in self-tracking apps and devices and the unique space that they occupy between the traditional health sector and the technology sector.
									Over the course of my PhD, I plan to research people with chronic health conditions who use self-tracking apps and devices, and I will focus on the ethics and privacy implications involved in their use. 
								In the context of health management, I believe patients come into self-tracking with very different goals and from very different circumstances, and self-trackers should allow patients to configure their experience to meet their goals, whatever they may be.</p>

								<h3>My projects</h3>
								<p> Beginning in the Fall 2022 semester, I will be working as a Graduate Research Assistant on the <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/dhh/">Digital Heart Health</a> project with a team spanning the UT School of Nursing and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. This project is exploring the potential of a digital game to improve sensor-controlled self-management for adults with heart failure. <br><br> 
								I have also been working for the last year on the Making Smart Tools Work for Everyone project as a part of the <a href="https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems/">Good Systems</a> grand challenge at UT Austin, which aims to design AI technologies that benefit society. 
									The project’s goal is to understand pain points of workers and how AI-enhanced smart hand tools might aid and improve their work.
									We are currently focusing on accessibility issues in the context of workers using hand tools.
									Our team is highly interdisciplinary (spanning the School of Information, the School of Public Affairs, and the Department of Mechanical Engineering), and we are both conducting qualitative research and designing a prototype of a “smart” hand tool.
									My sub-team from the School of Information has led qualitative interviews with UT student engineers and conducts subsequent analysis using NVivo software. </p>

						<h2>My experience</h2>
						<p>I worked at FasterCures, a Center of the Milken Institute for three years and served as a Senior Associate working on the Health & Technology team.
						My research explored a variety of issues related to the collection and use of health data, such as bias and underrepresentation that pervades datasets, trust in Big Tech, regulatory gaps in data protections, data collection and use during COVID-19, and the interoperability of disparate data systems and sources.
						Some of the reports I worked on during my time at the Milken Institute can be found below:</p>

						<h2>Personal</h2>
						<p>I was born and raised in Baltimore, MD, and went to the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA, where I received a B.A. in Sociology and French.
							I then spent 3 years living and working in Washington, DC before moving to Austin. <br> I have also spent time living in Switzerland and Morocco,
							both of which fueled my love for French. I also enjoy running, listening to new music, and walking around cities in hopes of finding their best bakeries.
