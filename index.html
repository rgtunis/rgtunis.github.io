								<h3>Withings | Design Research Intern | Summer 2023 & Summer 2024</h3>
								<p>I joined <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/">Withings</a> as part of the Design & Product Management team based in their Paris office for internships in both 2023 and 2024. 
									<br> During my first internship, my focus was on the app experience for users receiving alerts about heart rhythm irregularities. In addition to contributing to the design and 
									flow of several heart health functions, I <a href="#designwork">created a program</a aimed at Withings users with atrial fibrillation. 
									<br> During my second internship, I was focused on the user experience for individuals with hypertension using Withings blood pressure monitors. My work involved in-depth user research, including analyzing survey data from nearly 4000 users,
									developing personas, and presenting strategies for improving the user experience to the team.

								<h3>Digital Heart Health | Graduate Research Assistant | 2022 - Present</h3>
								<p> I am supporting a randomized controlled trial led by colleagues in the UT School of Nursing. The trial assesses the effectiveness of a sensor-controlled digital game to improve self-management behaviors in older adults with heart failure. I work directly with participants to help them install and navigate their study devices (including a Withings smartwatch and smart scale). I have led several publications and am leading the qualitative interview portion of the study. </p>

        <p>
          I am in the final stages of writing my dissertation and plan to defend in early 2026. My dissertation involves two studies:
        </p>
        <ol style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
          <li>
            A secondary analysis of data from a longitudinal RCT exploring relationships between 
            individual-level psychosocial factors, self-care behaviors, and engagement with digital 
            health technologies among adults with heart failure
          </li>
          <li>
            A 10-day diary study with individuals with Type 2 diabetes who use health tracking technologies 
            such as CGMs, employing user-centered design methods to address unmet needs in day-to-day self-care
          </li>
        </ol>
		  <p>
          Overall, my dissertation empirically examines mundane, day-to-day interactions with health technologies in order to understand how these interactions impact psychosocial factors that are critical to successful, long-term self-care, such as self-efficacy and motivation. The goal of my work is to contribute to the design of SCTs that support users in building their confidence, resilience, and sense of autonomy.

      My experience spans the full spectrum of the design processâ€” from journey maps and wireframing, to UX research and writing, to supporting prototype development and implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
     <b>Sample screens from my work at Withings:</b> 
		<br> <i>I worked on the user interface for a variety of heart health features and created a three-week educational program for Withings users with atrial fibrillation.</i>
