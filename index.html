						<h2>My research at UT Austin</h2>
						<p>My research focuses on health self-tracking technologies and the unique space they occupy in between the traditional health sector and the technology sector. Over the course of my PhD, I plan to focus on how self-tracking tools can be used in the self-management of chronic conditions, 
							especially cardiac conditions. I believe that patients come into self-tracking with very different goals and from very different circumstances, and self-trackers should allow patients to configure their experience to meet their goals, whatever they may be.</p>

									<p>I am a Graduate Research Assistant on the <strong><a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/dhh/">Digital Heart Health</a></strong> project with a team spanning the UT School of Nursing and Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering. We are conducting a 
										randomized controlled trial to explore the potential of a sensor-controlled digital game to improve self-management for adults with heart failure. In my role, I work directly with participants to help them install and learn to use the activity tracker and smart scale that they use throughout the study, 
										and I am conducting qualitative experience to better understand participants' experiences with these tools. </p>

									<p>I am also conducting research on self-tracking apps for patients with diabetes. This work is based in social science theory and its specific focus is agency-- whether users are afforded opportunities to personalize their tracking experiences to their own preferences and goals in meaningful ways.</p>

									<p>I previously worked on the Making Smart Tools Work for Everyone project as a part of the <strong><a href="https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems">Good Systems</a></strong> grand challenge at UT Austin, which aims to design AI technologies that benefit society. The project’s goal was to understand pain points of workers, accessibility issues, and how AI-enhanced smart hand tools might aid 
										and improve their work. I worked on a highly interdisciplinary team conducting qualitative research and designing a prototype of a “smart” hand tool.</p>

								<h3>Withings | Design Intern | Summer 2023</h3>
								<p>I was so fortunate to intern for <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/">Withings</a> in their office just outside Paris, France. While Withings creates a variety of innovative health monitoring technologies, 
									my focus was on the design and content of features within the app, specifically for users receiving alerts about heart irregularities. In addition to contributing to the design and 
									flow of several heart health functions, I independently created a three-week educational program aimed at Withings users with atrial fibrillation.</p>

						<h2>Personal</h2>
						<p>I was born and raised in Baltimore, MD, and went to the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA, where I received a B.A. in Sociology and French.
							I then spent 3 years living and working in Washington, DC before moving to Austin. <br> I have also spent time living in France, Switzerland and Morocco,
							which have all fueled my love of French. I also enjoy running, listening to new music, and walking around cities in hopes of finding their best bakeries.
