								<h3>Withings | Design Research Intern | Summer 2023 & Summer 2024</h3>
								<p>I joined <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/">Withings</a> as part of the Design & Product Management team based in their Paris office for internships in both 2023 and 2024. 
									<br> During my first internship, my focus was on the app experience for users receiving alerts about heart rhythm irregularities. In addition to contributing to the design and 
									flow of several heart health functions, I independently created a three-week educational program aimed at Withings users with atrial fibrillation. 
									<br> During my second internship, I was focused on the user experience for individuals with hypertension using Withings blood pressure monitors. My work involved in-depth user research, including analyzing survey data from nearly 4000 users,
									developing personas, and presenting strategies for improving the user experience to the team.

								<h3>Digital Heart Health | Graduate Research Assistant | 2022 - Present</h3>
								<p> I am supporting a randomized controlled trial led by colleagues in the UT School of Nursing. The trial assesses the effectiveness of a sensor-controlled digital game to improve self-management behaviors in older adults with heart failure. I work directly with participants to help them install and navigate their study devices (including a Withings smartwatch and smart scale). I have led several publications and am leading the qualitative interview portion of the study. </p>

								<h3>FasterCures, a Center of the Milken Institute | Senior Associate | 2018-2021</h3>
								<p> I worked at <a href="https://milkeninstitute.org/centers/fastercures">FasterCures, a Center of the Milken Institute</a> for three years on the Health & Technology team. My research explored a variety of issues related to the collection and use of health data in the context of 
									biomedical research, such as bias in health datasets, regulatory gaps in health data protections, and the interoperability of disparate health data systems and sources.  </p>

						<h2>Personal</h2>
						<p>I was born and raised in Baltimore, MD, and went to the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA, where I received a B.A. in Sociology and French, plus some computer science coursework that got me forever fixated on unpacking the social impact of technology.
							<br><br> I then spent several years living and working at a health think-tank in Washington, DC before moving to Austin in 2021 to begin my PhD. I have also spent time living in France, Switzerland and Morocco,
							which have all fueled my love of French. I also enjoy running and lifting, consuming new music/ pop culture, and walking around cities in hopes of finding their best bakeries.
